I have deployed a very simple PHP application using a simple MVC sturcture. Since this code has been written long time ago, documentation and demonstartion images are missing. I have written this code in highschool so the code does NOT follow best practices of software development and it has a lot of problems(unctached errors, security problems etc.) which have not been addressed.

Developed in 2019.
